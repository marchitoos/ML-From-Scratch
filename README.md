# Machine Learning From Scratch

## About

In a world with so many libraries that make all the machine learning for you, why make something *from scratch*?
The answer is simple: understand what the code is **really** doing, by making it yourself!
Because of that idea I decide to make many machine learning models by myself.

## Road Map

For now, I had planned the following models:

- Supervised
  - [ ] Linear Regression
  - [ ] Logistic Regression
  - [ ] Decision Trees

- Unsupervised
  - [ ] K-Means Clustering

- Neural Networks
  - [ ] Perceptron
  - [ ] Feedforward
  - [ ] Recurrent
  - [ ] LSTM
  - [ ] Convolution
